<h1>Deceit of Ideals</h1>

<p>Question my thoughts; ponder my life<br />
Just rot inside; let me die<br />
Don't dare preach fucking lies<br />
Its all been; a waste of time</p>

<p>This has been my waste of time</p>

<p>I can't see the end<br />
I don't understand<br />
I thought this was my life<br />
Not yours to bend<br />
The ideals break<br />
Thrown right in my face<br />
Deceit of your holy signs<br />
Lies I cannot take</p>

<p>Sell me your god; you can't, don't try<br />
Dismiss your guide; you'll burn in time<br />
Signs from above; dictate your life<br />
It's not for me; so why even try?</p>

<p>Steal my life<br />
Take my soul<br />
Leave me here<br />
With nothing at all<br />
End this game<br />
Rape my mind</p>

<p>I can't see the end<br />
I don't understand<br />
I thought this was my life<br />
Not yours to bend<br />
The ideals break<br />
Thrown right in my face<br />
Deceit of your holy signs<br />
Lies I cannot take</p>
