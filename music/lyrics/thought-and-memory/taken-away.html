<h1>Taken Away</h1>

<p>I cannot sleep tonight; you stole my light<br />
	This burns inside; now my father has died<br />
	We needed him; in vein you came<br />
And now that he's gone; we are left in pain</p>

<p>Taken away<br />
You took my blood<br />
I'm no longer breathing<br />
My heart it stopped<br />
All I feel is pain<br />
Keep screaming, won't help<br />
Can't fight your fate</p>

<p>Misery in site; this is not right<br />
My heart cries loud;  fate has left me out<br />
All of his pain; I shared within<br />
Taken away; I don't want you gone</p>

<p>Taken away<br />
You took my blood<br />
I'm no longer breathing<br />
My heart it stopped<br />
All I feel is pain<br />
Keep screaming, won't help<br />
Can't fight your fate</p>

<p>Taken away<br />
You took my blood<br />
I'm no longer breathing<br />
My heart it stopped<br />
All I feel is pain<br />
Keep screaming, won't help<br />
Can't fight your fate</p>

<p>I asked you not to, and you did it still<br />
Now I am left here with nothing to feel</p>
