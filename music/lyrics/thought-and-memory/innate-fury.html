<h1>Innate Fury</h1>

<p>Why do I do this to myself? Lay awake all night<br />
Can't put my thoughts into words<br />
Failure, disappointment, Do I make them proud<br />
High to escape reality, come crashing down</p>

<p>Things were simpler when I was young<br />
My youth, wasted away<br />
What am I running from? Who will understand?</p>

<p>INNER DEMONS!</p>

<p>Why do I do this to myself? Another person pushed away<br />
This is not who I am!<br />
Need to find reason, need to find rhyme<br />
End all my lies, I'm running out of time</p>

<p>Things were simpler when I was young<br />
My youth, wasted away<br />
What am I running from? Who will understand?<br />
The day will come and they will see<br />
When everyone has given up on me (give up on me)<br />
Pushing pulling, brain in a haze<br />
The things driving me crazy are the same<br />
Keeping me sane!</p>

<p>When I feel this way, I give in to my hate<br />
I'm more than you'll ever need, wont you please now fuckin' leave<br />
Just turn and walk away, don't wanna see your face<br />
Please leave me, please leave ME!</p>

<p>Family tries but I won't listen<br />
Too much pride, I'd rather die<br />
Stupid choices, Get sucked in<br />
This is not where I want, to, be</p>

<p>Things were simpler when I was young<br />
My youth, wasted away<br />
What am I running from? Who will understand?<br />
The day will come, they will see<br />
When everyone has given up on me<br />
Pushing pulling, brain in a haze<br />
The things driving me crazy are the same<br />
Keeping me sane!</p>
