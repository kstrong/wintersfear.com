<h1>Reign of Odin</h1>

<p>Walk through the land of Asgard<br />
Gungnir in hand<br />
I am the pyschopompos<br />
Leader of the lands</p>

<p>On a path to see a volva<br />
See'r of the truth<br />
Tales of past and future<br />
Including one's own doom<br />
Oedipism at Mimir's Well<br />
To gain the wisdom of ages<br />
Valkyries on the wild hunt<br />
Odin will REIGN</p>

<p>Ragnarok is soon approaching<br />
Now is the time<br />
For all the Einherjar<br />
To fall in line</p>

<p>On a path to see a volva<br />
See'r of the truth<br />
Tales of past and future<br />
Including one's own doom<br />
Oedipism at Mimir's Well<br />
To gain the wisdom of ages<br />
Valkyries on the wild hunt<br />
Odin will REIGN</p>

<p>Wisdom, War, Battle, Death<br />
Magic, Prophecy, Victory, Death</p>

<p>Valhalla!<br />
For you we wait<br />
Ragnarok!<br />
To seal this gods fate</p>

<p>I've got my Valknut <br />
Given for my faith<br />
Laid down my life<br />
For Odin we wait</p>
