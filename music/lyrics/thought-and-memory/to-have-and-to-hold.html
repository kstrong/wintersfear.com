<h1>To Have and to Hold</h1>

<p>My life changed<br />
I can't feel pain<br />
Am I the only one to blame?<br />
Am I the reason for this shame?<br />
Is this how it's meant to be in love?</p>

<p>My family<br />
Is not bound<br />
This is it<br />
Going down</p>

<p>You walked away<br />
I turned around <br />
I feel low<br />
I want time<br />
Is this how it's meant to be in life?</p>
<p>Broken home<br />
	It has all been done before<br />
	And it isn't what I wanted<br />
	This is not what I asked for!</p>
<p>My life changed<br />
I can't feel pain</p>

<p>You walked away<br />
I turned around<br />
I feel low<br />
I want time<br />
Is this how it's meant to be in life?</p>

<p>It hurts<br />
To be left behind<br />
And one thing i'll ask for<br />
Just answer me this question<br />
Is this how i'm meant to bleed inside?</p>

<p>My life changed<br />
I can't feel pain<br />
Am I the only one to blame?<br />
Am I the reason for this shame?<br />
Is this how it's meant to be in love? </p>

<p>Till death do you part<br />
No one has yet to die<br />
Then why is this separation alive?(2x)</p>
