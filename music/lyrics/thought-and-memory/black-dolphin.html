<h1>Black Dolphin</h1>
<p>My crimes on humanity, force fed these prophecies<br />
Blindfolded; I cannot see, no escape left from me</p>

<p>Trapped in a cage, within a cage<br />
Locked behind this fucking steel door<br />
No escape now, my last stop<br />
All shades of color turn to grey</p>

<p>Violent outbursts keep me in, no ability for early release<br />
There is no chance to escape, my final resting place</p>

<p>Trapped in a cage, within a cage<br />
Locked behind this fucking steel door<br />
No escape now, my last stop<br />
All shades of color turn to grey</p>

<p>There has been no sympathy<br />
The pain I feel was brought by me<br />
No one has ever escaped these walls<br />
When summer comes, winter still falls<br />
The cold I feel inside<br />
Swallowed up by my own pride<br />
Veins begin to ice over<br />
Death comes with solid blood</p>
