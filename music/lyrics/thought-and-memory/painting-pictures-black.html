<h1>Painting Pictures Black</h1>

<p>I want to believe in this<br />
I can not see it through this haze of my own life</p>

<p>It's not everything<br />
It is all i know<br />
And it is dying</p>

<p>It's not my fault<br />
That i bleed <br />
It's just something<br />
That's always been<br />
I can't go on!</p>
<p>I can't do this, i can't go on, i just wanna run, hide from my breath</p>
<p>Take all of this, take my sin, take everything, god left me</p>
<p>I can't breathe!</p>

<p>Take my own life, I don't want it!<br />
Shot in the head, left in my abyss!<br />
It's all I want, just to leave all this</p>
<p>Take my own life, I don't want it!<br />
Shot in the head, left in my abyss!<br />
It's all I want, just to leave all this</p>
