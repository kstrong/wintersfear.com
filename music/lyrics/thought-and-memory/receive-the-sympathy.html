<h1>Receive the Sympathy</h1>

<p>I'll paint this picture in my tears<br />
	Just listen now or disappear<br />
	I want to make us everything<br />
Our pains end when you agree</p>

<p>I've made mistakes, I know<br />
That's not now what I show<br />
I'm sorry for loving you</p>

<p>I tried to give this all I can<br />
This pain you can't even comprehend<br />
You don't even care to see my change<br />
This hurt drives me insane</p>

<p>I've made mistakes, I know<br />
That's not now what I show<br />
O'm sorry for loving you<br />
It's all I ever wanted to do</p>

<p>Scared? You ran<br />
Trust! In me<br />
I can make this up to you, it's up to you to see it true<br />
Hide? Please don't!<br />
Believe! This truth!<br />
I'm offering up myself, just give it up and let me in</p>
<p>I've made mistakes, I know<br />
That's not now what I show<br />
I'm sorry for loving you<br />
It's all I ever wanted to do</p>

<p>My actions speak much louder now<br />
Are you too blind to even see how?<br />
Too stubborn to even believe?<br />
Your running cures nothing</p>
