<h1>Blood Grip</h1>
<p>The spinning, I'm dizzy<br />
	The lies, I'm twisting<br />
	It's not what I think<br />
	It's just who you are</p>

<p>FUCK<br />
Whatever I see<br />
Whatever I feel<br />
Whoever I am<br />
The emotions tear me down</p>


<p>Bleeding, slipping, can't grasp you<br />
Lies, deceit, all on you<br />
This is the last time<br />
Last time you'll be untrue</p>


<p>FUCK<br />
Whatever I see<br />
Whatever I feel<br />
Whoever I am<br />
The emotions tear me down<br />
The emotions tear me down</p>

<p>It's all lies,<br />
From this day forward,<br />
You and I will never feel pain again,<br />
Dead, but only for eternity,<br />
This is my blood grip</p>

<p>FUCK<br />
Whatever I see<br />
Whatever I feel<br />
Whoever I am<br />
The emotions tear me down<br />
The emotions tear me down</p>

<p>In time we will feel again</p>

<p>You're not, it's not<br />
Your cries, you lie!<br />
You're not, it's not<br />
You lie!<br />
It's not true!</p>
